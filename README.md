Struct that implements the logic of the reduced fraction, and NUnit tests for its verification. 
Conversion operations to/from int, double are implemented. 
Arithmetic operations on reduced fractions are implemented.

Operations implemented:
1. ReduceFraction * ReduceFraction
2. ReduceFraction / ReduceFraction
3. ReduceFraction + ReduceFraction
4. ReduceFraction - ReduceFraction
5. ReduceFraction * int
6. ReduceFraction / int
7. ReduceFraction + int
8. ReduceFraction - int

Convertions implemented:
1. ReduceFraction to double (implicit)
2. ReduceFraction to int (explicit)
